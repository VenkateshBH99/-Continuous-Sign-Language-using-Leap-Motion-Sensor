# -Continuous-Sign-Language-using-Leap-Motion-Sensor
The project deals with sign language recognition using hand gestures.The Leap motion sensor is used to extract the required palm and finger features that constitute for better recognition mechanism.To avoid redundancy in the data features extracted from the sensor, we limit ourself to the finger and palm centre 3D coordinates in this work. I have used two machine learning models - SVM and LSTM, to predict the sign. By continuously running the system for a set of gestures, continuous conversation recognition is possible. The models were trained and tested using 42 different sign words and 28 sentences. LSTM outperformed with accuracy 98.21 %.
