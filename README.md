# -Continuous-Sign-Language-using-Leap-Motion-Sensor
Worked on hand gestures and recognizing the words and to combine them to form a meaningful sentences. I have used two machine learning models - SVM and LSTM, to predict the sign. The models were trained and tested using 42 different sign words and 28 sentences. LSTM outperformed with accuracy 98.21 %.
