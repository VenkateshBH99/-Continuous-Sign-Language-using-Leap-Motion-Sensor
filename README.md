# -Continuous-Sign-Language-using-Leap-Motion-Sensor
Worked on hand gestures and recognizing the words and combine them to form a meaningful sentences. Used combination of Indian and American Sign Language for creating dataset. I have used two machine learning models - SVM and LSTM, to predict the sign.  The models were trained and tested using 42 different sign words and 28 sentences. LSTM outperformed with accuracy 98.21 %.
